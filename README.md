# Precision-Control-of-6-DOF-Robot-Arm-with-Multiple-Nonlinear-Methods
This repository includes simulink models of all six different nonlinear algorithms and the full version of paper in pdf format.

The 6-DOF robot arm used today are driven by high-precision servo motors, equipped with optical or magnetic encoders, efficient closed-loop control systems, reducers, and digital signal processors (DSP) â€“ all features lacking in low-cost servo motors like famous MG996R. This low-cost motor is only equipped with a potentiometer and a PI controller to detect position and adjust speed. Additionally, the usage of metal gears affects control accuracy due to backlash causing slight spatial movement when changing direction, further reducing precision. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to optimizing the system of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot arm built by low-cost servo motors using six different control strategies, including internal and external adaptive PI control, model reference adaptive control (MRAC), sliding mode control (SMC), fuzzy logic PI control, and reinforcement learning (RL). The goal of using these nonlinear methods is to enhance system precision, stability, and dynamic response. Some series of precise movements (e.g. coffee art) controlled by the robot arm will be represented on the day of project exhibition.
